    <h1>zeitgeist.css</h1>

    <p><a href="http://github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css" title="zeitgeist.css on Github">zeitgeist.css</a> is a crowdsourced, extendable basic CSS file that imparts a design based on current design aesthetics to any simple HTML file, such as those produced by compiling <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="Daring Fireball: Markdown">markdown</a>.</p>

    <p>zeitgeist.css has the following goals:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Enable any HTML page to maintain a modern appearance effortlessly.</li>
        <li>Ensure any page can easily embrace basic design best practices for readability, usability, accessibility, and compatibility.</li>
        <li>Provide a central repository for community knowledge and examples of these best practices, and a history of how they change over time.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>zeitgeist.css contains basic CSS normalization and best practices from <a href="http://h5bp.com" title="HTML5 Boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. Responsive design rules for desktop, tablets, and mobile phones are included, a set of styles for printing, and styles for projectors as well.</p>

    <h2>The spirit of the time</h2>

    <p>Any page that links to the current version of zeitgeist.css will have a design that changes as zeitgeist.css changes. These changes are based on contributions and community decisions regarding the current state of web aesthetics, technology, and platform support.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, a page can use a zeitgeist.css revision for any point in time in order to present a design reminiscent of that time period. The repository is tagged at the end of every month in order to facilitate linking to a revision from a specific point in time.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>Link directly to the current, regularly-updated master:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="//github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css/raw/master/zeitgeist.min.css" /&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>Link to a specific tagged version:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="//github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css/raw/july-2012/zeitgeist.min.css" /&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Contributing</h2>

    <p>Since zeitgeist.css is supposed to be representative of the opinions and knowledge of the web community as a whole, it needs the input of a large part of that community in order to be successful. If you're a designer, developer, or anyone else who feels the current state of zeitgeist.css doesn't reflect current design aesthetics or best practices, there are two ways to contribute:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Open a new <a href="https://github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css/issues" title="zeitgeist.css Issues">issue</a> describing your opinion or idea.</strong>
        Provide example code and/or links. This will allow the community to debate your suggestion and decide as a group if it should be included.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css/fork_select" title="Fork zeitgeist.css">Fork</a> the code, make the necessary changes, and submit a pull request.</strong>
        Include a description of and rationale for the changes you've made. This will also require community feedback, but it's much easier for me to merge your changes.</p></li>
    </ol>
